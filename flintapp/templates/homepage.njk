      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>This vulnerability was discovered by Benoit Côté-Jodoin. Its severity is considered critical. However, it was patched in version 1.1.10.</p>
      <p>Flint is a CMS built to be easy to use and super flexible. Your content needs to fit into more layouts and environments than anyone but you can plan for, so Flint enables you to make the templates you need and fill it with your content. It's a CMS that is built for those who want to fully design the front-end of their website without wanting to deal with static site generators or older content management systems (that are slow and use outdated technology).</p>
